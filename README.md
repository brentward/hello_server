# hello_server
Multi-threaded web server writer in Rust as example exercise.
This server implements multiple threads using message passing and uses 
reference counting and a mutex to lock access in order to ensure thread safety.

It was written as a learning exercise for the Standford CS140e Raspberry Pi 
operating system in Rust project.
